# FourthYearProject - VR Visualisation of Volumetric Data

This is my fourth year dissertation project, developed for the HTC Vive using Unity to benefit researchers and public outreach schemes. 

## Getting Started

To run the project you can either checkout the main branch and build it yourself through unity, or hopefully once its ready I'll set up a build branch.

### Prerequisites

Unity: 2019.2.5f1 or later.
Steam VR
The Steam VR SDK (currently available through the Unity app store)
